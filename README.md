# Hey everyone!

I'm currently learing html, CSS and Javascript and other necessary applications in a bootcamp for Web-Development. My last activity was in a chemical company, because i studied Chemistry (B. of Sc.). Then i decided to change to a new professional field, and now i am really exited to become a junior web-developer.<br>
