# Hey everyone!

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning html, CSS and Javascript and other necessary applications in a bootcamp for Web-Development.<br/> My last activity was in a chemical company, because i studied Chemistry (B. of Sc.). Then i decided to change to a new professional field, and now i am really exited to become a junior web-developer!<br/>

Below you can see which skills i am about to learn...
